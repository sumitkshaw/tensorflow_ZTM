# TensorFlow Practice: Zero to Mastery

Welcome to the TensorFlow Practice repository! This repository contains my practice and implementation of concepts from the **Zero to Mastery TensorFlow course**. It serves as a hands-on companion to the course, documenting my learning journey in mastering TensorFlow for deep learning and machine learning applications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following sections, each corresponding to major topics covered in the course:

- **01_basics/**: Introduction to TensorFlow, tensors, and basic operations.
- **02_data_pipeline/**: Data preprocessing, loading, and pipeline creation.
- **03_neural_networks/**: Building, training, and evaluating neural networks.
- **04_cnn/**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data.
- **05_rnn/**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data.
- **06_custom_models/**: Creating custom models and layers.
- **07_deployment/**: Deploying TensorFlow models for production.

Each section contains Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts with examples, exercises, and projects.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive learning)
- Required libraries as specified in `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sumitkshaw/tensorflow-practice-zero-to-mastery.git
